                  We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not
                  store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted
                  through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                  (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction
                  data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your
                  purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
                  transaction information is not saved.

                  <br />
                  Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
                  managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a
                  joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express

                  <br />
                  PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit
                  card information by our store and its service providers.

                  In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
                  collect, use and disclose your information to the extent

                  However, certain third-party service providers, such as
                  payment gateways and other payment transaction processors,
                  have their own privacy policies in respect to the information

                  transactions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy
                  policies so you can understand the manner in which your
                  personal information will be handled by these providers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In particular, remember that certain providers may be located
                  in or have facilities that are located in a different
                  jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed
                  with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party
                  service provider, then your information may become subject to
                  the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider
                  or its facilities are located.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a
                  third-party website or application, you are no longer governed
                  by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
